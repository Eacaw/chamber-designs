# Typewriting Monkeys

## A Genetic Algorithm

### Problem Statement

> We've heard that a million monkeys at a million keyboards could produce the complete works of Shakespeare; now, thanks to the Internet, we know that is not true. - Robert Wilensky

Given a string of length `L` and a set of `N` characters, what is the optimal configuration of a genetic algorithm to generate the string? What differences do differing ways of implementing selections have on the algorithm's performance? Is it better to mutate at a high percentage rate, and how can we define a robust ranking system? These are the questions I will be exploring in this project.
