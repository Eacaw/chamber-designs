# Starting a new portfolio

## Introdcution

I've been meaning to start a portfolio for a while now, but I've never really had the time to do it. Recently, I've been working on a few exciting projects and I thought it would be a great opportunity to showcase them. I'm excited to share my work and demonstrate my skills through my portfolio.

## Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! This is the place where I showcase my projects and demonstrate my skills. I'm thrilled to share my work with you and invite you to explore the exciting projects I've been working on.

## Blog

In the blog section of my portfolio, I'll be documenting my journey, sharing insights, and engaging with the community. It's not just a blog, but a progress tracker and a space for me to keep notes. Join me as I embark on new adventures and discover the latest trends in software development.

## About me

Hey there! I'm Dave, a passionate software engineer in my 30s. Currently, I'm working at Certinia, where I've gained valuable experience over the past three years. I'm dedicated to creating high-quality software solutions and constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

## Portfolio plans

I have big plans for my portfolio! It's not just a static collection of projects; it's an open project workboard. I'll be showcasing my ongoing projects, experimenting with new technologies, and exploring different approaches to web development. Join me on this exciting journey as we push the boundaries of what can be achieved.
